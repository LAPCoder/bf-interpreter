# Brainfuck interpreter

This i a very simple interpreter for the Brainfuck language (BF).
See [the hello world](./test_hello.bf) for syntax.

I made a JS interpreter years ago [on my website](https://lapcoder.github.io/transpiler/brainfuck/) but is was not very... efficient.

I am planning to add a compiler (to assembly) function.
